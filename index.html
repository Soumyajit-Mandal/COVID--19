    <h2><u>Investigation in to the origin :-</u></h2>
    
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">There are several ongoing efforts by scientists, governments, international organisations, and others to determine the origin of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Most scientists say that as with other pandemics in human history, the virus is likely of zoonotic origin in a natural setting, and ultimately originated from a bat-borne virus. Several other explanations, including many conspiracy theories, have been proposed about the origins of the virus.
            SARS-CoV-2 has close genetic similarity to multiple previously identified bat coronaviruses, suggesting it crossed over into humans from bats. Research is ongoing as to whether SARS-CoV-2 came directly from bats or indirectly through any intermediate hosts. Initial genome sequences of the virus showed little genetic diversity, although subsequently a number of stable variants emerged (some spreading more vigorously), indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS-CoV-2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. Health authorities and scientists internationally state that as with the 2002–2004 outbreak of SARS-1, efforts to trace the specific geographic and taxonomic origins of SARS-CoV-2 could take years, and the results could be inconclusive.

        <h2><u>Treatment and management of COVID-19</u></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">There is no specific, effective treatment or cure for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. One year into the pandemic, highly effective vaccines have now been introduced and are beginning to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2; however, for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination, treatment remains important. Thus, the lack of progress developing effective treatments means that the cornerstone of management of COVID-19 has been supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support and prone positioning as needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.
        </p>
     <h2><u>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2</u></h2>  
     <p style="font-size: 20px;">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.The virus was previously referred to by its provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). First identified in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is contagious in humans. As described by the US National Institutes of Health, it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak</p> 
        <h2><b><u> Prevent the spread of COVID-19:</u></b></h2>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;"> Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 20px;">Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
            
        </ul> 
        <p style="font-size: 30px;"> If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.Call in advance so your healthcare provider can direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
        Masks
        Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</p>
